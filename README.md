### Some notes to Gerko: 
- As of yet I don't have access to the main data files. Therefore, the subfolder `3.main_analysis` is work in progress. In order for you to get an idea about the future repository structure, I did already set up some initial files/projects/structure in this folder. 
- On the main page, you might observe that Jan-Willem is a collaborator. The reason for this is that I wanted to check whether someone invited to this repository could commit directly to the main branch. Well, apparently they can... I removed the commits from the git history, however Jan-Willem is still listed as collaborator on the main page of the project. I did some research to find out how to reverse this, but couldn't find anything that worked. If you happen to have an idea, im glad to hear it. Just removing the commits from the history didn't do the trick. (I by the way also contacted the GitHub customer service to see if they can help).
- The complete git history of the LaTeX manuscript (in the `1.latex_manuscript` subfolder) does not date back fully to the start of this manuscript, but rather initiates slightly later in time. The reason for this is that I initially used overleaf, and as a consequence I didn't log git history of the document. Therefore, only the very early work on the manuscript was not logged via git. 
- The structure of the `3.single_modular_analysis` & `4.multi_modular_analysis` parts of the repository may as of yet seem a bit messy / unlogical. The reason for this is that I didn't really start on this part of the thesis. Therefore, I can't clearly define the structure yet, for I don't know which kind of structure will work.
